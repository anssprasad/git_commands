* Standard glob patterns work.
* You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
* You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
* # a comment - this is ignored
* *.a # no .a files
* !lib.a # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
* /TODO # only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
* build/ # ignore all files in the build/ directory
* doc/*.txt # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
